**Notes:**
- The key is to tie your metrics directly to the business problem you’re solving—how will you know your solution made a difference?
- outlines the scope and scale of the 'business problem'
- identify baseline metrics that describe the issue
- illustrate and estimate the projected benefit of the project to various stakeholders in terms of dollars, impact, and so forth with specific KPIs
- track and communicate project success.

**Overview & Business Problem:**
Field service task assignment is currently performed using manual or rule-based processes that do not account for technician expertise, performance history, or task complexity. As a result, assignments are often mismatched, leading to:
- Failed or delayed task completions
- Increased penalty costs and rework expenses
- Lower customer satisfaction scores
- Technician frustration, burnout, and turnover risk

These inefficiencies scale with operational volume, creating significant financial, operational, and reputational impacts that limit the company’s ability to grow and compete effectively.

**Scope & Scale of the Problem (Baseline Metrics):**

Category	Metric / KPI	Current Baseline	Business Impact
Operational	Expertise Match Rate (Tasks assigned to technicians with proven skill in similar tasks)	62%	Inefficient task allocation leads to higher failure rates
	Task Completion Rate (Tasks completed successfully on first visit)	75%	Failed visits require costly rework and delay downstream jobs
Financial	Penalty Costs for Delays	$350,000 / year	Direct financial losses from SLA violations and late appointments
	Rework Costs (Repeat visits, technician time, travel)	$420,000 / year	Reduces overall productivity and resource utilization
Reputational	Customer Satisfaction Score (e.g., CSAT or NPS)	72 / 100	Lower satisfaction impacts retention, referrals, and brand reputation
Workforce Impact	Technician Turnover Rate (annual)	18%	Burnout and dissatisfaction increase hiring/training costs

**Projected Benefits & Target Metrics:**

The automated task matching system is expected to deliver quantifiable improvements across operational, financial, and reputational dimensions. The table below outlines target metrics to be tracked during and after project implementation.

Category	Metric / KPI	Baseline	Target / Expected	Projected Benefit
Operational	Expertise Match Rate	62%	≥ 85%	Improved assignment accuracy
	Task Completion Rate	75%	≥ 90%	More tasks completed successfully on first visit
Financial	Penalty Costs	$350K	↓ 40%	~$140K annual savings
	Rework Costs	$420K	↓ 30%	~$126K annual savings
Reputational	Customer Satisfaction Score	72	≥ 85	Stronger brand loyalty and retention
Workforce Impact	Technician Turnover Rate	18%	↓ 5 pp	Lower recruitment and training costs

**Success Measurement Approach:**

To ensure clear, trackable outcomes, these metrics will be measured at three key points:

Baseline (Pre-Implementation):
Establish metric baselines using historical data over the past 6–12 months.

Midpoint (During Implementation):
Monitor metrics during pilot or phased rollout to validate early trends.

Post-Implementation (Project End):
Evaluate final metrics against targets to assess full impact.

Additional follow-up evaluations may occur quarterly to track sustained benefits and identify opportunities for further optimization.

**Stakeholder Impact Summary:**
Stakeholder Group	Benefit Area	Expected Impact
Operations Team	Better visibility, fewer manual assignments	Higher productivity and reduced scheduling time
Technicians	Assignments matched to skill set	Increased job satisfaction, reduced burnout
Customers	Faster, more reliable service	Higher satisfaction, retention, and referrals
Executives / Finance	Reduced penalties, increased efficiency	Direct financial savings and competitive advantage
Brand & Marketing	Stronger reputation, higher NPS	Easier customer acquisition and loyalty building
