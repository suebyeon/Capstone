**Executive Summary:**
The Automated Technician Task Matching System is a strategic initiative designed to optimize the assignment of field service tasks to technicians by leveraging historical performance data, technician expertise, and task characteristics. Current manual scheduling processes lead to suboptimal task-to-technician matches, resulting in lower task completion rates, costly delays, inconsistent service quality, and technician burnout.

This project will deliver an intelligent, data-driven matching solution that enhances operational efficiency, reduces costs, and improves both customer and technician satisfaction. By aligning task assignments with technician strengths, the organization can increase task success rates, minimize penalty costs, and improve customer trust — strengthening both financial and reputational performance.

**Problem:**
Customers rely on fast and reliable connections for work, school, and social life. There is a strong need to provide the best connectivity in the telecom market. While many companies can claim to have the best and most advanced network technology, customers cannot feel that if the direct service from technicians do not match the high quality internet service. In other words, they have a great product but poor experience which will result to decrease in customer loyalty and lose estimated $2.09 billion per year from customer churn rate. 

**Objective:**
- Improve Operational Efficiency: Automate technician task assignment to reduce manual scheduling errors and administrative overhead.
- Enhance Task Success Rates: Match tasks to the most qualified technicians, improving completion rates and service reliability.
- Reduce Operational Costs: Lower penalties and rework costs associated with delays and misassignments.
- Improve Customer Experience: Increase on-time service delivery and quality, driving higher customer satisfaction scores.
- Support Scalable Growth: Create a flexible, data-driven infrastructure that can adapt to business expansion and evolving service demands.

**Scope:**
The project encompasses the design, development, and deployment of an automated technician-task matching system.
- Development of a matching algorithm that uses technician attributes (expertise, performance history, availability) and task data to optimize assignment decisions.

- Creation of a user interface and dashboard for dispatchers and field staff to monitor assignments and performance.
- Integration with existing scheduling, CRM, and workforce management systems.
- Establishment of a data pipeline and backend infrastructure to support real-time processing.
- Implementation of a feedback loop for model refinement over time.
- Change management activities to ensure adoption by dispatchers, technicians, and leadership.

**Expected Results and Value:**
This project delivers measurable financial, operational, and reputational benefits:

Financial:
- Reduction in penalty costs from delays
- Lower rework and repeat-visit expenses
- Better utilization of technician hours

Operational:
- Increased task-to-technician expertise match rate
- Higher task completion and on-time performance
- Streamlined scheduling workflows with less manual intervention

Reputational:
- Improved customer satisfaction and trust through reliable service delivery
- Strengthened technician engagement and reduced burnout
- Enhanced brand reputation as a technologically advanced, service-oriented organization

These benefits support both short-term operational gains and long-term strategic positioning, ensuring the organization remains competitive in a service-driven market.

**Business Importance:**
In the industry of telecom, the success of a company is very reliant on the customer's satistfaction and how well can you retain the customer and keep them happy. If they are unhappy with the service or quality or experience, they will likely leave you as their provider and go to a competitor which will result to you lose industry competitiveness. There is also escalating rework costs from failed assignments. If you stick with the legacy system, the technology will eventually not be able to scale to the fast paced and growing market. From the technician side, the continued mismatching of the jobs will increase turnover and burnout which could result to union action and negative reviews.

**High Level Plan and Prioritized Acitivites:**
The project will follow a phased approach aligned with the CRISP-DM methodology:
- Business Understanding & Data Assessment (Oct 3–10)
- Data Preparation & Modeling (Oct 11–Nov 7)
- Evaluation & User Testing (Nov 8–Nov 21)
- Deployment & Rollout (Nov 22–Dec 3)

Key deliverables include:
- Working matching algorithm and dashboard prototype
- Integrated backend with existing systems
- Pilot deployment with select technician groups
- Post-deployment performance review and stakeholder presentation

**Data/Technical Framework and Method:**
The solution leverages modern data science and software engineering practices to ensure scalability and maintainability:
- Data Sources: Historical task data, technician profiles, performance logs, CRM data
- Data Processing: Data cleaning, transformation, and standardization pipelines
- Modeling: Machine learning algorithm trained to optimize technician-task matches based on historical success patterns
- System Architecture: Backend services for real-time assignment, frontend UI for monitoring and adjustments, and APIs for system integration
- Tools & Infrastructure: [e.g., Python, scikit-learn, Flask/FastAPI, cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, etc.]
- Security & Compliance: Adherence to data privacy regulations and secure handling of technician and customer information

**Success Measurement:**
To measure success to financial benefit, we can measure the total penalty cost for delays. To measure operational benefits, we monitor the expertise matching rate and task completion rate. To measure reputational benefit, we measure customer satistfactions score.

**Communication:**
Successful adoption requires not only technical execution but also organizational alignment. Key activities include:
- Stakeholder Engagement: Regular updates with business stakeholders, field operations, and IT leadership to align expectations and ensure transparency.
- User Training: Sessions for dispatchers and technicians on new tools and workflows.
- Feedback Loops: Incorporating user feedback to refine both the algorithm and UI during pilot deployment.
- Communication Plan: Targeted messaging to highlight benefits, address concerns, and promote adoption.

These efforts will ensure that the project is not only technically successful but also embraced across the organization
